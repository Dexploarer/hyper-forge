# Create New ADR

I'll help you create a new Architecture Decision Record following the established template.

## ADR Template Structure

Each ADR includes:
1. **Title** - Clear decision statement
2. **Date** - When decided
3. **Status** - Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded
4. **Context** - Current situation, pain points, requirements
5. **Decision** - What we decided
6. **Alternatives Considered** - Other options and why rejected
7. **Consequences** - Positive, negative, and neutral impacts
8. **Implementation** - Action items, timeline, success metrics
9. **References** - Links to docs, commits, related ADRs
10. **Notes** - Additional context

## Next ADR Number

Based on the current ADRs (0001-0011), the next number is **0012**.

What decision would you like to document?

I'll use Deepwiki to research similar ADRs and best practices, then create a comprehensive ADR following the project's established format.
