# Asset Forge Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Asset Forge! This guide will help you get started creating amazing 3D assets for your game.

## Getting Started

### 1. Choose Your Asset Type

Start by selecting what you want to create:

- **Avatars**: Characters, NPCs, creatures with optional rigging
- **Items**: Weapons, tools, armor with material variants

### 2. Describe Your Asset

Give your asset a name and detailed description. The more specific you are, the better the results!

**Example for a weapon:**

```
Name: Ancient Battle Axe
Description: A weathered double-bladed battle axe with Norse runes carved into the handle. The metal shows signs of age with rust patches, and the wooden grip is wrapped in worn leather.
```

### 3. Configure Generation Options

#### GPT-4 Enhancement

Uses GPT-4 to enhance your prompt for better 3D generation results. Adds technical details and optimizes for the AI.
