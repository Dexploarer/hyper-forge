# Patterns to match test files (Bun tests ONLY - NOT Playwright)
# Only matches .test.ts and .test.tsx files
# This excludes .spec.ts/.spec.tsx which are used by Playwright
testMatch = [
  "**/__tests__/integration/**/*.test.ts",
  "**/__tests__/unit/**/*.test.ts",
  "**/__tests__/helpers/**/*.test.ts"

# Exclude E2E tests (Playwright), node_modules, and other non-test directories
testIgnore = [
  "**/__tests__/e2e/**",      # Playwright E2E tests - EXCLUDE ALL
  "**/*.spec.ts",              # Playwright spec files
  "**/*.spec.tsx",             # Playwright spec files
  "**/node_modules/**",
  "**/dist/**",
