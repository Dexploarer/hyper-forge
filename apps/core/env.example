# AI Creation System Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and add your actual API keys
#
# ============================================
# DEVELOPMENT WITH PRODUCTION SERVICES
# ============================================
# To run frontend locally while using production services (CDN, Database, Qdrant):
# 1. Set production service URLs below (DATABASE_URL, CDN_URL, QDRANT_URL, etc.)
# 2. Run: bun run dev (or bun run dev:frontend + bun run dev:backend)
# 3. Frontend will connect to local backend via Vite proxy
# 4. Local backend will connect to production services
#
# See DEV_WITH_PRODUCTION.md for detailed instructions
# ============================================

# Client-side environment variables (must be prefixed with VITE_)
# To point frontend directly to production backend, set:
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-production-backend.up.railway.app
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
VITE_MESHY_API_KEY=your-meshy-api-key-here
VITE_IMAGE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3004
VITE_GENERATION_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
VITE_PIPELINE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=1500
VITE_DEBUG_PIPELINE=false

# Backend API Keys (for server-side operations)
# Note: If running server-side code, you may also need these without VITE_ prefix
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
MESHY_API_KEY=your-meshy-api-key-here

# Meshy polling configuration (server-side)
# Polling interval in milliseconds (default 5000)
MESHY_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=5000
# Overall default timeout in milliseconds (default 300000 = 5 minutes)
MESHY_TIMEOUT_MS=900000

# Optional per-quality timeouts (override default) in milliseconds
# Examples suitable for longer-running tasks
MESHY_TIMEOUT_STANDARD_MS=600000
MESHY_TIMEOUT_HIGH_MS=1200000
MESHY_TIMEOUT_ULTRA_MS=1800000

# Optional Meshy model selection
# Default if no per-quality model provided
MESHY_MODEL_DEFAULT=meshy-5
# Per-quality model overrides (optional)
MESHY_MODEL_STANDARD=meshy-5
MESHY_MODEL_HIGH=meshy-5
MESHY_MODEL_ULTRA=meshy-5

# Server Configuration (avoiding conflicts with Hyperscape)
# API Server port (default: 3004, Hyperscape uses 3001)
# The API server uses Elysia running on Bun for 22x better performance
API_PORT=3004

# CORS Configuration
# Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS requests
# Required when credentials: true (can't use wildcard "*")
# Examples:
#   Development: CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3003
#   Production: CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
# If not set, will use FRONTEND_URL (if set) and localhost origins in development
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=

# Image Server URL (optional, defaults to API server)
# For external image hosting (S3/R2/CDN), override this with public URL
# For local dev, leave blank to use Elysia API server at http://localhost:3004
IMAGE_SERVER_URL=

# Server Backend - Elysia on Bun
# - 22x better performance (2.4M req/s)
# - Native Bun file handling for faster static file serving
# - End-to-end type safety with TypeScript
# - Built-in file upload support without middleware

# ==================== Authentication (Privy) ====================
# Privy provides secure, industry-standard authentication with JWT tokens
# Supports Web3 wallets, email, social login, and more
#
# ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION:
# You can use different Privy apps for testing vs production:
# - Development/Testing: Create a test Privy app at https://dashboard.privy.io
# - Production: Use your production Privy app
# - Both apps can share the same database (users are identified by privyUserId)

# Frontend Privy App ID (VITE_ prefix for client-side access)
# This is a PUBLIC identifier safe to use in frontend code
# Format: Usually starts with "cl" (e.g., "clx123...")
# Development: Use your test Privy app ID
# Production: Use your production Privy app ID
# Find it at: https://dashboard.privy.io/apps/[your-app]/settings
VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id_here

# Frontend Privy Client ID (VITE_ prefix for client-side access)
# Required for newer Privy SDK versions (v3.0+)
# Format: Usually starts with "client-" (e.g., "client-...")
# If not set, will fall back to VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID
# Find it at: https://dashboard.privy.io/apps/[your-app]/app-clients
VITE_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID=your_privy_client_id_here

# Backend Privy App ID (server-side)
# Should match VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID for the same environment
# Development: Use your test Privy app ID
# Production: Use your production Privy app ID
PRIVY_APP_ID=your_privy_app_id_here

# PRIVY_APP_SECRET - Your Privy application secret
# This is a PRIVATE credential - NEVER expose in frontend code
# Only use server-side for verifying authentication tokens
# Development: Use your test Privy app secret
# Production: Use your production Privy app secret
# Find it at: https://dashboard.privy.io/apps/[your-app]/settings
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=your_privy_app_secret_here

# PRIVY_VERIFICATION_KEY - Optional public key for faster JWT verification
# Improves token verification performance by using local public key verification
# instead of making API calls to Privy for every token verification
# If not provided, Privy SDK will fetch it automatically (adds ~100ms per request)
# Find it at: https://dashboard.privy.io/apps/[your-app]/settings
PRIVY_VERIFICATION_KEY=

# ADMIN_PRIVY_IDS - Comma-separated list of Privy DIDs for admin users
# Admins can modify/delete any asset regardless of ownership
# Format: did:privy:abc123,did:privy:def456
# Regular users can only modify their own assets
ADMIN_PRIVY_IDS=

# ==================== Database Configuration ====================
# PostgreSQL database connection string
# Development: Use local database (e.g., postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname)
# Production: Use Railway database URL (e.g., postgresql://postgres:pass@prod-db.railway.app:5432/railway)
# For local dev with production data: Copy DATABASE_URL from Railway production service
DATABASE_URL=

# ==================== Vector Database (Qdrant) ====================
# Qdrant vector database for semantic search
# Development: Use local Qdrant (e.g., http://localhost:6333)
# Production: Use Railway Qdrant URL (e.g., https://qdrant-production.up.railway.app)
# For local dev with production data: Copy QDRANT_URL from Railway production service
QDRANT_URL=
QDRANT_API_KEY=

# ==================== CDN Configuration ====================
# CDN service stores all generated 3D models, emotes, audio, etc.
# All assets are uploaded directly to CDN during generation
# Development: Use your local CDN server URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:3005)
# Production: Use your Railway CDN URL (e.g., https://cdn-production-4e4b.up.railway.app)
# For local dev with production data: Copy CDN_URL from Railway production service
CDN_URL=

# CDN API key for uploading files (REQUIRED IN PRODUCTION)
# Must match CDN service's CDN_API_KEY
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
CDN_API_KEY=

# CDN WebSocket URL for real-time upload event notifications
# Development: ws://127.0.0.1:3005/ws/events
# Production: wss://cdn-production-4e4b.up.railway.app/ws/events
# NOTE: Requires CDN_API_KEY to authenticate
CDN_WS_URL=

# AUTO_PUBLISH_TO_CDN - Automatically publish assets to CDN after generation
# When enabled, assets are automatically uploaded to CDN and made available
# Set to "false" in development if you want manual control over publishing
# Default: true (recommended for production)
AUTO_PUBLISH_TO_CDN=true

# ==================== Admin Security ====================
# CRITICAL: Secure admin operations endpoints
